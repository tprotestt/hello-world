Learning me some github

My name is Brennan Bunch. I have a BS in Information Systems and I've been a Web Developer for a local private health system for 3 years. I've kind of ignored programming in my non professional life, mostly because I didn't enjoy it very much. That being said, I have improved significantly as a developer in the last year and would like to improve upon my skills. I am starting the 100 days of code today! 

Non code related interests include lifting heavy weights, hiking, and going to hardcore shows!
